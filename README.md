Repo Overview
=============

This repo contains the logic for the basic sort algorithms in the syntax of C++.

These basic sort algorithms are: 
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort

I also made the size parameter an r-value so you can simply just insert sizeof(*array name*) / sizeof(*arrays data type*), but does it really matter? No, not really.
